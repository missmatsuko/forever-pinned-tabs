# forever-pinned-tabs
Keep pinned tabs pinned, forever.

<!--
TODO:
- add pinned tabs on browser start (doesn't trigger windows.onCreated; runtime.onStartUp and runtime.onConnect don't work either)
- open pinned tabs only if they are not already open (currently just opens when there are no pinned tabs at all)
- add options for URLs (currently hard-coded)
- add browser extension icons
- open links from pinned tabs in new tab?
